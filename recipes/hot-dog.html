        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The hot dog was invented in 1983, by Colonel Harland David Sanders while trying to perfect his fried chicken recipe.</p>
        <p>While not fried chicken, the hot dog is still edible for sustenance, in moderation, for adult humans. The food is incrediby addictive to children aged 2-6, and affects their inferior brains much like the schedule 1 drug, crack cocaine, would affect an adult brain.</p>
