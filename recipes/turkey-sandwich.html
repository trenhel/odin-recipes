        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The turkey sandwich, invented by Colonel Harland David Sanders in 1603, was an accident of sorts. The sandwich came to be when the Colonel was attempting to perfect his fried chicken recipe.</p>
        <p>This sandwich is a staple of the American lazy person's lunch, accompanied regularly with disgusting fried potato discs covered in flavor powder. While it fills the stomach, it does not fill the heart.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Turkey, sliced</li>
            <li>2 slices Bread</li>
            <li>Lubricant (Mayonnaise or Miracle Whip)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>1 slice Cheese (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="steps">
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a knife, spread a thin layer of the lubricant of your choice on each slice of bread</li>
            <li>Sprinkle a bit of salt on one or both sides. Be careful, salt will kill you if used improperly.</li>
            <li>Place several slices of turkey onto one slice of the bread.</li>
            <li>If desired, place a slice of cheese either on top of the turkey, or on the other slice of bread, whichever is your personal preference.</li>
            <li>Place one slice of the bread, other ingredients included, on top of the other slice of bread. Be careful to make sure that the ingredients are touching each other during this step. You want them to be "inside" the sandwich.</li>
            <li>Use a knife, potentially the same one you used to spread your lubricant, to slice the sandwich in half. This step is completely optional, and there are many, many ways to slice the sandwich. Don't be afraid to experiment!</li>
        </ol>
